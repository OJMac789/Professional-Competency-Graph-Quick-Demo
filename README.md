## üéØ Executive Summary

The Professional Competency Graph System revolutionizes government workforce development by automatically extracting leadership competencies from meeting transcripts and collaborative work sessions. This AI-powered solution addresses Ontario's critical succession planning challenges while creating evidence-based advancement pathways that recognize diverse forms of professional excellence.

### Key Capabilities

- **Real-time competency extraction** from meeting transcripts using Microsoft Fabric AI with future state goals to include FORTE and HR related datastreams.
- **Dynamic professional development tracking** with competency evolution over time
- **Automated advancement evidence generation** reducing documentation time by 70%
- **Neurodivergent-optimized design** recognizing pattern recognition and analytical strengths

## üß† The Innovation

Traditional professional development relies on periodic reviews and self-reported activities, missing the rich competency demonstrations that occur naturally in meetings, mentoring sessions, and collaborative work. Our system makes this invisible professional development visible and trackable.

### Problem We Solve

- **22% of OPS workforce** becomes retirement-eligible within 5 years
- **Career progression satisfaction** currently at only 60%
- **Manual advancement documentation** creates barriers for analytically excellent employees
- **Institutional knowledge transfer** happens without systematic capture

### Our Solution

AI analysis of meeting interactions automatically identifies and tracks:
- Leadership behaviors and coaching effectiveness
- Technical expertise and systems thinking
- Crisis management and decision-making capabilities
- Emotional intelligence and stakeholder management
- Knowledge sharing and mentoring activities

## üõ† Technical Architecture

Built on **Microsoft Fabric's** government-approved infrastructure:

- **Azure OpenAI** for natural language processing and competency extraction
- **Power BI** for real-time competency visualization and trend analysis
- **EventStream** for meeting transcript ingestion and processing
- **Microsoft Purview** for data governance and privacy compliance

### Privacy-First Design

- Automatic PII redaction and data minimization
- Differential privacy mechanisms protecting individual identification
- Role-based access controls with audit trails
- Full compliance with Ontario privacy legislation and AI directives
